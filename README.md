Hello folks! 
I came across with this beautiful UI designed orginally by Apple for iOS native application such as Reminder app , Maps.


This project was bascially developed from scratch using [Create react native app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started). 

[React native animatable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-animatable) turned out to be a boon for this kind of UI project.

**Checkout my customized [boilerplate](https://github.com/geekygaurav/react-native-redux-saga-garvax) here on github**
